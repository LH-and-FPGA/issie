    # FIX: This is no longer true, likely due to update of "peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4"
    # A new personal access token must be generated to allow the GitHub Actions workflow to push to the repository.
    # The token must have the 'repo' scope.
    # Generate here https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
    # Add the token to the repository secrets as ISSIE_DOCS_TOKEN
