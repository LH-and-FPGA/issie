# Fable Elmish Electron Template

## Building and running the app

> In the commands below, yarn is the tool of choice. If you want to use npm, just replace `yarn` by `npm` in the commands.

* Install JS dependencies: `yarn install`
* Install F# dependencies: `dotnet restore`
* Start Fable daemon and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) dev server: `yarn start`
* In another terminal, `yarn run launch`

> The first two steps are only necessary the first time or whenever the dependencies change.

## Disclaimer 

This example is just an elmish version of default [Fable Electron template](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable-templates/tree/master/electron/Content).
