# FYP - Marco Selvatici

## Building and running the app

* Install JS dependencies: `npm install`
* Install F# dependencies: `dotnet restore`
* Start Fable daemon and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) dev server: `npm start`
* In another terminal, `npm run launch`

> The first two steps are only necessary the first time or whenever the dependencies change.
