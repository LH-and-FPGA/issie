# Updating the documentation

### Introduction

The ISSIE documentation is generated by [fsdocs](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/) from Markdown documents using a Github action build `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. This action outputs a static website as generated by `fsdocs` to the root directory on the `gh-pages` branch of the repo. Changes to this branch are automatically deployed to the documentation website.

 To change the documentation PR the markdown files to ISSIE `master`, rebuilding will be automatic when the changes are committed to `master`.

The Markdown source files can be found on the ISSIE repo:

* Documentation Pages: `/docs/*.md`
* ISSIE Blog Pages: `/docs/updates/*.md`
* Embedded (PNG) graphics: `/docs/img/**.*.md`
* In documentation source files the file path separator is always `/`

For developer preview of changes set up the repo as for code development and use `dotnet fsdocs build` in the repo root directory. You can find markdown file output under `/output` but note that it will not pick up web references from there so pictures and some links will not work.

We ought to have a better way to do local documentation previews!

#### Debugging

Documentation builds for ISSIE need a secret key on the repo generated as documented [on the wiki](https://github.com/tomcl/issie/wiki/0-Project-Documentation-Website).

This must be regenerated every 6 months or so.
