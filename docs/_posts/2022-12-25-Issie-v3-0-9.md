The major changes from last year have now survived Autumn Term testing with a few minor changes and fixes to improve the all-new waveform simulation display. Next term will have more serious user testing with a few hundred students using the waveform simulator to run and debug a multi-sheet EEP1 CPU.

For the period of the Spring term there will be no new features - and bug fixes as needed. We hope not many will be needed.

This year the main Issie development is the simulator, where `0x6770` (Yujie Wang) is working on a branch that will use a variety of techniques to speed up the simulator by a large amount. Yujie will also be making a few additions to the recommended Issie tool chain and style guide.

Happy Christmas and New Year to all issue users!
