# Getting Started

## Users

Go to the [latest ISSIE release](https://github.com/tomcl/issie/releases/latest). Scroll down this page till at the bottom you find the `Assets` section - this has binaries for Windows and Macos and linux PCs. Download the appropriate one and unzip it anywhere (or add the dmg file to applications under Macos by double-clicking). 

No installation is required - ISSIE runs from the unzipped files under windows if you double-click the top-level `issie.exe` file with the blue ISSIE chip icon. The Windows binaries are currently unsigned

Issie is designed to be intuitive with no manual required. Users will find the one page [User Tutorial](userGuide.html) here is a useful introduction to Issie features. It can be skimmed quickly to see what is possible, or followed in detail for an easy introduction.

### Creating binaries

It is possible for users to create their own binaries from source, if for example the latest release does not have an uploaded set of binaries. Binaries for a given platform can be created on that platform and run successfully without signing. Follow the steps in [Getting Started](https://github.com/tomcl/ISSIE#getting-started).

## Developers

See the  [Getting Started](https://github.com/tomcl/ISSIE#getting-started) section of the repo README for how to develop Issie code.

Development is possible on Macos or Windows.
