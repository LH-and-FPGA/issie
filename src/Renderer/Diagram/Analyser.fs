// Ports constraints:
// - Source ports must be output ports.
// - Target ports must be input ports.
// - All ports have at least one connection that touches them.
// - Input ports have precisely one connection that touches them.

// Check combinatorial loops?

/// Check that:
/// 1- all source ports in connections are Output ports,
/// 2- all target ports in connections are Input ports,
/// 3- all input ports in a component are actually input ports,
/// 4- all output ports in a component are actually output ports,
/// 5- all ports on components have a port number,
/// 6- all ports on connection do not have a port number.
/// These conditions should always hold, unless there are bugs in the code (i.e.
/// no user behaviour should be able to trigger such errors).
/// The costruction of the Simulation graph assumes that these rules hold.
/// TODO: should they crash the program then?
