    This module collects functions that allow to feed input into the simulation,
    effectively allowing to run it.

// During simulation, a Component Reducer function will produce the output only
// when all of the expected inputs have a value. Once this happens, it will
// calculate its outputs and set them in the next simulationComponent(s).

/// Take the Input, and feed it to the Component with the specified Id.
/// If the Component is then ready to produce an output, propagate this output
/// by recursively feeding it as an input to the connected Components.
