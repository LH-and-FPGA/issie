(* HLP23

    This module will normally be used exclusively by team member doing the "smart autoroute on single
    wire creation" part of the individual coding. During group phase work how it is used is up to the
    group. Functions from other members MUST be documented by "HLP23: AUTHOR" XML 
    comment as in SmartHelpers.

    It does not need specific "get started" test code since is called whenever a new wire is created 
    or (not usual) a symbol is moved so far that the topology of a wire chnages and it is autorouted 
    again from scratch.
