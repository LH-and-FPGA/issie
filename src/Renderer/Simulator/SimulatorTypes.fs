// In addition outputs are contained in a big array indexed by epoch (simulation time). This allows results for multiple
// steps to begin built efficiently and also allows clocked outputs for the next cycle to be constructed without overwriting
// previous outputs needed for that construction.

// between its graph and root. Following issie this does not include a custom component for the sheet being simulated, which is viewed as
// root. Since custom components have been removed this no longer complicates the simulation.
