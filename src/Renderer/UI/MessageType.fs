(*
WaveSim state.

Principles: 
1) at any time wavesim simulates a stored model.LastSimulatedCanvas circuit which is guaranteed working if it exists 
2) pressing "simulate button" updates this circuit
3) wavesim has two views: adder and waveforms. each waveform is the signal on a netGroup (set of connections from one driver to multiple sources).
4) waveforms display view based on: selected waveforms, zoom, cursor position, etc
5) simulation is rerun automatically as needed to generate current display, but previous simulation results are reused where possible
6) adder view interfaces with current circuit, colouring selected nets green, and allowing selection on nets to determine
selected waveforms. If current circuit has changed only driving components still on circuit can be used this way.
7) simulate button color determines status; if circuit has chnaged from that simulated it will be orange (errors) or green (OK to rerun simulation).
8) list of currently displayed ports is held in state and saved / restored with each sheet. LastSimulatedCanvas (and simulation data) are not saved/restored but
are recalculated when needed. List of possible to display ports used by waveadder

Data structures for internal state

LastSimulatedState: Record with canvas, netlist, ports, initial simulation etc all recreated whenever simulation button is pressed and absent initially and after simulating with errors.
WaveAdder: Record always present contains simulation parameters, including which ports are currently selected

WaveAdder is
